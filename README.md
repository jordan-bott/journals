## Welcome to my coding journal!

Here you will find lots of my writing and notes for code that I have worked on. There are also individual journals specific to the projects found within their own repositories. However this will serve as a place to write everything that I worked on in the day, rather than just that tied to a specific project. Some days will have identical entries within a project and this general journal, but some days will have vastly different entries!

Once again, welcome in, and enjoy the read!
