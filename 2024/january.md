## January 1, 2024

### Today I worked on:

#### Seediy:

- Moving the project to github, and making sure I can push/pull from the correct repository
- Updating the ReadMe with the current place of the project + the future of the project

**AH-HA!💡**

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**
Finally getting back to work on Seediy after a long hiatus!

### Bugs encountered 🐛🐞🐜 :

🪲 Github was pushing with my wrong username (jordan-bott77) even using SSH and updating my username on my computer

**\~Solution~**
Had to run `git config --global user.email` and change to my dev email instead

### Today I worked on:

#### Seediy:

- Fixing the formatting for the adding a seed form
- Displaying the name of the foreign key in the dropdown rather than the id

**AH-HA!💡**
I don't have to use "event" to update states from "forms", and I can pass in a parameter instead!

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**

- Making progress (even when tired)

### Bugs encountered 🐛🐞🐜 :

🪲 None today 🤞🏼

## January 5, 2023

### Today I worked on:

#### Eat the Rainbow:

- Initial project setup
  - Typescript React
  - Tailwind
- Project research
  - Found good information on the FDA website
  - Undecided if I need more

**AH-HA!💡**

A partial ah-ha, I've been debating weather to make Eat the Rainbow in HTML/CSS or use React. After thinking through some of the basic functionality, I think it would be nice to use React so that I can have states track a "what I'm planning to eat today" list to more easily see if you've eaten each color.

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**

Excited to get started on Eat the Rainbow!
