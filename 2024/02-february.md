## February 8, 2024

### Today I worked on:

- Began planning Young and I's next project (a pantry app!)
- Looked into React Native, and building a mobile app

**AH-HA!💡**

React Native is similar, but definitely different from React (as suspected!)

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**

- Excited to build a new project with Young again!
